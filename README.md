## Overview

The MyFlix movie app will provide users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to register, update their personal information, and manage a list of their favourite movies.

The server-side comprises a well-designed REST API and a MongoDB Database, whereas the client-side user interface is built using the React framework, completing the MERN-stack. It is still unter construction.

At its current state, the app can be started by running `parcel [path to index.html]` in the terminal. This will return a localhost port that can be used to access the app in the browser.
